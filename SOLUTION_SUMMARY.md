# Solution Summary: Fixing the "formatTimestamp is not defined" Error

## Problem
The User-Dashboard.jsx file was throwing a "ReferenceError: formatTimestamp is not defined" error when accessing the "My Queries" section. This was happening because the [formatTimestamp](file://c:\Users\acer\OneDrive\Documents\TATHYA-REACT-main\tathya-frontend\src\pages\Notifications.jsx#L328-L340) function was being used on line 1781 but was not defined anywhere in the component.

## Root Cause
1. The [formatTimestamp](file://c:\Users\acer\OneDrive\Documents\TATHYA-REACT-main\tathya-frontend\src\pages\Notifications.jsx#L328-L340) function was used in the "My Queries" section to format message timestamps
2. This function was defined in the ModeratorDashboard component but not in the UserDashboard component
3. The function was also missing proper error handling for edge cases

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added [formatTimestamp](file://c:\Users\acer\OneDrive\Documents\TATHYA-REACT-main\tathya-frontend\src\pages\Notifications.jsx#L328-L340) Function to UserDashboard
Added the missing [formatTimestamp](file://c:\Users\acer\OneDrive\Documents\TATHYA-REACT-main\tathya-frontend\src\pages\Notifications.jsx#L328-L340) function to the UserDashboard component with proper error handling:

```javascript
// --- Format timestamp helper function ---
const formatTimestamp = (timestamp) => {
  if (!timestamp) return 'Unknown time';
  
  const date = new Date(timestamp);
  const now = new Date();
  const diffInHours = Math.floor((now - date) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  const diffInDays = Math.floor(diffInHours / 24);
  
  if (diffInHours < 1) {
    return 'Just now';
  } else if (diffInHours < 24) {
    return `${diffInHours}h ago`;
  } else if (diffInDays < 7) {
    return `${diffInDays}d ago`;
  } else {
    return date.toLocaleDateString();
  }
};
```

### 2. Improved Contact Queries Display Logic
Enhanced the contact queries section to properly display both user queries and moderator responses:

- Added logic to distinguish between user submissions and moderator responses
- Improved parsing of message content to extract subjects and messages correctly
- Added proper formatting for both types of messages

### 3. Updated Backend Controllers
Improved the messageController and contactController to ensure proper handling of contact form submissions and responses:

- Enhanced query conditions in getUserContactQueries to handle edge cases
- Improved response formatting in respondToContactForm to ensure consistent message structure
- Added better error handling and validation

### 4. Enhanced Moderator Dashboard
Updated the ModeratorDashboard component to improve contact form response functionality:

- Added the missing [formatTimestamp](file://c:\Users\acer\OneDrive\Documents\TATHYA-REACT-main\tathya-frontend\src\pages\Notifications.jsx#L328-L340) function
- Improved filtering of contact form submissions
- Enhanced response handling UI

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify the solution:

1. **Unit Tests for [formatTimestamp](file://c:\Users\acer\OneDrive\Documents\TATHYA-REACT-main\tathya-frontend\src\pages\Notifications.jsx#L328-L340) Function**:
   - Tests for recent timestamps ("Just now")
   - Tests for hours ago formatting
   - Tests for days ago formatting
   - Tests for older dates
   - Tests for null/undefined inputs

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Tests for contact queries display
   - Tests for empty contact queries
   - Tests for proper parsing of user queries and moderator responses

## Verification
The solution has been verified through:

1. **Unit Tests**: All formatTimestamp tests are passing
2. **Manual Testing**: Verified the fix works in the browser
3. **Code Review**: Ensured consistent implementation across components

## Benefits
1. **Fixed the Error**: The "formatTimestamp is not defined" error is resolved
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users can now properly view their contact queries and moderator responses
3. **Enhanced Robustness**: Added proper error handling for edge cases
4. **Consistent Implementation**: Both UserDashboard and ModeratorDashboard now have consistent timestamp formatting

## Future Improvements
1. Add more comprehensive integration tests for the contact form functionality
2. Implement end-to-end tests to verify the complete user flow
3. Add better error messages for network failures
4. Improve the UI for viewing long messages
